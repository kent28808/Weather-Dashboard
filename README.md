# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This is my sixth project, where I was tasked with creating a weather dashboard application that allows the user to view current weather temperatures for any location in the USA, and a 5-day forecast.
This application uses a third party API to grab weather data that includes temperature, humidity, windspeed and UV index.
