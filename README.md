# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This is my fitth project, where I was tasked with creating a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day.  
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
[Moment.js] was used to display the current date and time.
